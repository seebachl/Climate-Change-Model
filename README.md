# Climate-Change-Model
This repository acts as supplementary material to the paper "Small-Scale Model for Climate Change on Earth" by Lily Seebach, supervised by Dr. Miroslav Lovric at McMaster University. The code used to model how a hypothetical landform would change in the next 100 years due to climate change is provided. 
This code acts as a foundation for small, detailed climate models. Readers are encouraged to download the code themselves and change values and parameters to see how the landform evolves differently. Further, the code can be enhanced by refining some of the mechanisms which model climate change processes.
